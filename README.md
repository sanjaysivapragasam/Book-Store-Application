# Book-Store-Application


Leading a 5-member team, a book store application using Visual Paradigm for conceptual designing, and Java and JavaFX in NetBeans for code implementation was accomplished. The app includes features for customers to purchase books in combination with a points-based reward system for discounting purposes based on their status. Additionally, the application also allows the owner of the application to facilitate all responsibilities related to book inventory including adding and deleting books to maintain their customer database. The application is viewed in a single window GUI-based using JavaFX, and all project planning, designing and coding was conducted by following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and patterns. This included the state design pattern to allow for changes in customer behaviour based on their status and points updates, and the singleton pattern to ensure there is only 1 instance of the owner of the book store respectively. Below are images showcasing the different diagrams used in planning and a sample view of the GUI.
